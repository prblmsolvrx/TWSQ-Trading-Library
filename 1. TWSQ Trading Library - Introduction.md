# TWSQ Trading Library

## Introduction

The TWSQ Trading Library is a powerful tool designed for backtesting and live trading of fully automated quantitative strategies in cryptocurrency markets. It specializes in deploying strategies based on price-volume data, which are particularly effective in less efficient markets like cryptocurrencies.

### Key Features:
1. Backtesting capabilities
2. Live trading on Kraken (with plans to add more exchanges)
3. Focus on price-volume based strategies (statistical arbitrage)
4. Extensible for additional datasets and asset classes

### Current Limitations:
- Live trading is currently only available on Kraken
- Primary focus is on price-volume data (though custom data can be incorporated)

### Installation

1. Download the `twsq` codebase
2. Open your terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the downloaded folder
4. Run the following command:
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

For developers who want to build on top of this library:
```
python setup.py develop
```

This allows any changes made to the code to be immediately reflected without the need for reinstallation.

### Setting up TWSQROOT Directory

The library needs a location to save data and results. By default, it creates a folder called `MyTWSQ` in your home directory.

To set a custom location:
1. Create an environment variable named `TWSQROOT`
2. Set it to your desired path, e.g., `/User1/codebase/`

The library will then create and use a folder `/User1/codebase/MyTWSQ`

To verify your TWSQROOT location:

```python
from twsq.utils import get_twsqroot
get_twsqroot()
```

Data saved in this directory includes:
1. Price-volume cache files
2. Backtest / live trading results (positions, PnL, etc.)
3. Log files
